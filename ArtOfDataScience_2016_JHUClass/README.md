## Team1's Repo (SAMPLED 2018.02.04)
This repository is a modified repository from Akash's team project in the Johns Hopkins University 2016 Art of Data Science Class (Upward Spiral of Science), used as a repo of sample work which Akash collaborated on or did. In assignments and final report, Akash mostly did/contributed to descriptive, exploratory and some inferential work.

## Table of Contents - Art of Data Science 2016

- *Final Report*: [``final_report.md``](final_report.md)
  > Final report summarizing work performed throughout the course.

- *Assignment 1*: [``./draft/summary.md``](./draft/summary.md)
  > Significance and Feasibility analysis of our proposed project topic. 

- *Assignment 2*: [``./draft/questions.md``](./draft/questions.md)
  > Asking the 6 types of scientific questions about our project topic

- *Assignment 3*: [``./draft/new+revised_questions.md``](./draft/new+revised_questions.md), [``./code/descriptive_exploratory_answers.ipynb``](./code/descriptive_exploratory_answers.ipynb)
  > Begin answerting the descriptive and exploratory questions. After answering them, we will revise the questions and discuss those that we couldn't fully answer as well as ask follow-up informative questions.

- *Assignment 4*: [``./code/inferential_simulation.ipynb``](./code/inferential_simulation.ipynb)
  >  Formally asked inferential question about our data, and answered it on simulated data from the null model, alternate model, and real data

- *Assignment 5*: [``./code/regression_simulation.ipynb``](./code/regression_simulation.ipynb)
  > Formally asked classification question about our data, and answered it on simulated data from the alternate model, and real data

- *Assignment 6*: [``./code/test_assumptions.ipynb``](./code/test_assumptions.ipynb)
   > In the previous two assignments, we made assumptions about our data. Now, we will check them and see whether or not they are true, and if not, update our understanding or assumptions about our data to those which are *more* right.

- *Assignment 7*: [``./draft/presentation.pdf``](./draft/presentation.pdf)
  > Presentation about findings and methods used throughout the project. 

- *Assignment 8*: [``./draft/progress_report.md``](./draft/progress_report.md)
  > Report stating all analysis completed to date, as well as logical next steps.

- *Assignment 9*: [``./code/extended_exploratory_combined_team1.ipynb``](./code/extended_exploratory_combined_team1.ipynb), [``./code/New_Analysis_akash.ipynb``](./code/New_Analysis_akash.ipynb)
  > 10  new questions about previous analysis and data (group and individual).

- *Assignment 10*: [``./draft/Assignment10_list.md``](./draft/Assignment10_list.md), [`./code/Assignment10_Group.ipynb```](./code/Assignment10_Group.ipynb), [``./code/Assignment10_Akash.ipynb``](./code/Assignment10_Akash.ipynb),
  > 10 new questions about previous analysis and data (group and individual).

  > New questions about previous analysis and data (group and indiviual). Focus on exploring the "spike" in our data as well as evidence for the cortical layers.

- *Assignment 12*: [``./draft/Assignment12_list.md``](./draft/Assignment12_list.md), [``./code/Assignment12_Akash.ipynb``](./code/Assignment12_Akash.ipynb),[``./code/Assignment13_Akash.ipynb``](./code/Assignment13_Akash.ipynb)
  > New questions about previous analysis and data (group and individual). Focus on imaging data and building evidence for cortical layers in our data.
