# revised questions:
### Descriptive
- Now that we know what the unmasking variable is, what effect does it have on our data?
- Now that we have a method for clustering data, let's analyze it. Are there patterns we see in the data with a certain cluster number?
- <<still waiting for inhibitory/excitatory data>>

### Exploratory
- Would another clustering method give us similar results?
- Can we use the unmasking variable to weight clusters differently? Will the centers of the clusters change significantly from this?
- Can we incorporate the unmasking variable in our density function? How does this change our results?

### new questions:
- What do we consider outliers? what do they represent?
- What is the statistical significance of our pmf / results
- What is the set of (x,y,z) removing outliers
- Redoing/analyzing everything without outliers
