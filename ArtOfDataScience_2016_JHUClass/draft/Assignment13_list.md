What we're working on individually and as a group

* Fixing older analyses and cleaning up plots.
* Fixing image extraction program
* Investigating image data
  * Compare older analysis to images corresponding to chunk of data we're looking at
  * Can we see anything we originally inferred from our statistical analysis?
  * Extract any useful visulatizations that support our analysis or show interesting features
  * What does the spike look like? What do layers across the y look like? Do we see any obvious synapse density distribution patterns?
* Exploring the layering we see in the y-direction.
* Finding evidence to convince ourselves that the layers across y may be cortical layers.
* We plan to look back on our recent clustering analyses and try to find patterns and build up more evidence convincing ourselves of these patterns (as well as with future clustering analyses)
* We plan to look back on our regressions and try to figure out why the successful ones worked well and why others worked poorly and what those assumed about our data to gain more insight.
