### What we're working on individually and as a group (these things are converging more and more each week)
* Getting more evidence to supporting the spike being noise/not being noise (we'll see which evidence is more convincing)
  * Looking at distributions of synapse density in the spike across x,y,z
  * Fixing older analyses. In histograms, make bin size a function of sample size.
* Investigate image data
  * Preliminaries: figure out how units line up with our data, e.g. what are our data coordinates in nanometers/micrometers? What do regions of high synaptic density look like in the image data? Can we see layers? 
  * Plot cluster analyses, gradient estimations, etc. overtop of image data.
* Exploring the layering we see in the y-direction.
  * Visualizations
  * Analysis of image of dataset and comparison of our statistical analysis to what we see in the image (are there any obvious hints that these may be the cortex layers?)
  * What do the layers look like in the image of the dataset.
  * Heat maps of the y-layers. How is density distributed across these y-slices?
  * Spatial distribution analysis in the image as well as with our dataset. What do we see?
  * Testing assumptions and ruling out distributions for synapses within these layers
  * Finding evidence to convince ourselves that these may be cortical layers.
* We plan to look back on our recent clustering analyses and try to find patterns and build up more evidence convincing ourselves of these patterns (as well as with future clustering analyses)
* We plan to look back on our regressions and try to figure out why the successful ones worked well and why others worked poorly and what those assumed about our data to gain more insight.
