  > Graduate/Senior level class taught by Joshua Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University exploring the reiterative and non-linear process of data science. Our team used Python 2.7 and a variety of DS libraries (Pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.) to explore a dataset of synaptic density in the visual cortext (density of connections between neurons in the brain) and see what we can find.
