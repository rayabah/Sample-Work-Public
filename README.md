- *Art of Data Science - 2016*: [``Classwork Folder``](./ArtOfDataScience_2016_JHUClass)
  > Graduate/Senior level class taught by Joshua Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University exploring the reiterative and non-linear process of data science. Our team used Python 2.7 and a variety of DS libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, etc.) to explore a dataset of synaptic density and spatial distribution in the visual cortext (density and physical spacing of connections between neurons in the brain). We recorded our progress over the semester and summarized our observations in the final report. 
  - *Data Set:* *M. musculus* V1 dataset from *Network anatomy and in vivo physiology of visual cortical neurons* (Bock et al).
  - *Final Report*: [``final_report.md``](./ArtOfDataScience_2016_JHUClass/final_report.md) Spatial Distribution of Synaptic Desnity
    > Final report summarizing work performed throughout the course.
